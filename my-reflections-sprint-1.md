Q1. Have a look at what the internet says on how to think like a programmer. What patterns do you see? What do you notice?
A1. A common thing the internet says about programmers is that they are problem solvers. If you have a problem, look at it from multiple angles or approaches until you come to a solution. It's reiterrated that it's not about learning syntax, but about problem solving.

Q2. What does the internet say about Flipped learning? What is flipped learning and flipped classroom? How do you think it will relate to your learning journey?
A2. Active learning. As opposed to traditional classroom settings where a teacher may give the student information which they are expected to memorise, flipped learning is about actively engaging in the content. It is learner directed vs. teacher directed. Teachers in this environment take on more of an observational role, providing feedback. They allow controlled chaos! In the classroom environment it looks like all the homework has been flipped into the class environment. So at home students will do their own learning in their own time(watching online lectures), do their own research, and then engage with concepts in the classroom with the guidance of a mentor.
Put another way it's when learning is moved to the individual learning space and the group space (where traditional classes and lectures take place) is turned into a dynamic and interactive learning environment where the teacher guides students.
